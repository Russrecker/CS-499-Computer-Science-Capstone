# Weight Tracker App Artifact

This folder has the original and enhanced versions of my Weight Tracker Android app for the CS-499 Capstone.

## What’s inside
- **Original** – the app before I made any changes  
- **Enhancement 1 – Software Design and Engineering** – code and write-up for the line graph feature  
- **Enhancement 2 - Algorithms and Data Structures** - code and wirte-up for the merge sort feature
- **Enhancement 3 - Databases** - code and wirte-up for the notes feature

Each enhancement folder includes:
- the updated files for that feature  
- a short PDF that explains the changes and how they connect to the course outcomes
